# Wage History Fix - Implementation Instructions

## Summary of Changes

This fix resolves the wage history sorting and "Current" badge display issues by implementing automatic wage date management. The system now properly handles wages entered in any order and automatically adjusts end dates.

## Files to Update

### 1. **app/Models/User.php**
- Added `recalculateWageEndDates()` method that automatically manages wage end dates
- Updated `currentWage()` relationship to get the wage with the latest start_date
- Modified `setWage()` to call recalculation after any wage changes
- Added `deleteWage()` method for safe wage deletion with recalculation

### 2. **app/Livewire/UserManagement.php** 
- Updated `openWageHistoryModal()` to properly identify the current wage (latest start_date)
- Modified `saveCurrentWageEdit()` and `addNewWage()` to use the User model's `setWage()` method
- Ensures automatic recalculation happens after any wage modification

### 3. **resources/views/livewire/user-management.blade.php**
- Modified the Wage History Modal section (see wage-history-modal-section.blade.php)
- Changed logic to use `is_current` flag instead of checking `end_date`
- Current badge now appears on the wage with the latest start_date

### 4. **DELETE: app/Models/WageHistory.php**
- This file is redundant and should be deleted
- The application uses UserWageHistory.php exclusively

## How It Works

1. **When any wage is added or edited**, the system:
   - Saves the wage with the provided information
   - Calls `recalculateWageEndDates()` automatically
   
2. **The recalculation process**:
   - Gets all wages ordered by start_date (ascending)
   - Sets each wage's end_date to (next wage's start_date - 1 day)
   - The wage with the latest start_date gets end_date = NULL (making it current)
   
3. **Display logic**:
   - Wages are displayed newest first (descending by start_date)
   - The "Current" badge appears on the wage with the latest start_date AND null end_date
   - The highlighted row (green background) follows the Current badge

## Example Scenario

If you add wages in this order:
1. Current wage: Aug 15, 2025 at $23/hour
2. Starting wage: May 27, 2022 at $15/hour  
3. Mid-period wage: Sep 08, 2023 at $17/hour
4. Another raise: Mar 22, 2024 at $19/hour

The system automatically sets:
- May 27, 2022: end_date = Sep 07, 2023
- Sep 08, 2023: end_date = Mar 21, 2024
- Mar 22, 2024: end_date = Aug 14, 2025
- Aug 15, 2025: end_date = NULL (Current)

## Installation Steps

1. **Upload the files** to their respective locations:
   - User.php → app/Models/User.php
   - UserManagement.php → app/Livewire/UserManagement.php
   
2. **Update the blade file**:
   - Replace the Wage History Modal section in resources/views/livewire/user-management.blade.php
   - Use the content from wage-history-modal-section.blade.php
   
3. **Delete the redundant file**:
   ```bash
   rm app/Models/WageHistory.php
   ```
   
4. **Clear caches** (if needed):
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   ```

5. **Test the functionality**:
   - Add a new wage for an existing user
   - Verify the end dates adjust automatically
   - Confirm the "Current" badge appears on the correct row
   - Try adding wages out of chronological order

## Key Benefits

- **Automatic date management**: No manual end date entry needed
- **Handles out-of-order entry**: Add historical wages anytime
- **Data integrity**: Only one wage can be "current" at any time
- **Accurate display**: Current badge always on the latest wage
- **Clean codebase**: Removed redundant model file

## Notes

- The system preserves all existing wage data
- No database migrations are needed (uses existing table structure)
- The display order remains newest-first as requested
- All wage notes and metadata are preserved during recalculation
