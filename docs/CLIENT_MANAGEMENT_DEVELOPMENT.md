# Client Management Development Plan

## üìã Project Overview
The Client Management system is a comprehensive time tracking module for the Lingo Client Tracker that tracks employee time against client contracts, monitors monthly hour allocations, identifies billable overages, and provides detailed reporting capabilities.

**Created**: January 2025  
**Status**: üöß In Development  
**Priority**: High  
**Focus**: Time tracking and contract hours management

---

## üéØ Development Principles

### UI/UX Standards (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **daisyUI Components ONLY** - No raw Tailwind for components
- [ ] **Dark Theme** - Use `bg-base-100/200/300` exclusively
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive** - Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px
- [ ] **Consistent with User Management** - Match existing patterns
- [ ] **Loading States** - All async operations must show feedback
- [ ] **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Form Validation** - Real-time validation with Livewire

### Code Standards
- [ ] **Reuse Existing Components** - Check `/resources/views/components/` first
- [ ] **Follow Naming Conventions** - Match existing file/class patterns
- [ ] **Complete Files Only** - No partial implementations
- [ ] **Test Each Feature** - Full debugging before moving on
- [ ] **Document Complex Logic** - Clear comments where needed

## üìä Database Schema

### Key Business Rules
‚úÖ **No Hour Rollover** - Unused hours expire each month  
‚úÖ **Account Numbers** - First 8 letters of company name (e.g., "Lingo Technologies" ‚Üí "LINGOTEC")  
‚úÖ **Contract Numbers** - Format: ACCOUNT-CON-SERVICE-YEAR (e.g., "LINGOTEC-CON-WEB-2024")  
‚úÖ **Anniversary Reset** - Hours reset on contract start date each month  
‚úÖ **Multiple Contracts** - Clients can have IT, WEB, MARKETING contracts simultaneously  
‚úÖ **Overage Rates** - Each contract has its own overage rate  
‚úÖ **Work Location** - Track if work was performed remotely or onsite  
‚úÖ **Email Reports** - Monthly overage reports sent on contract anniversary

## üé® UI Component Patterns

### Standard List View Pattern
```blade
<div class="card bg-base-200 shadow-xl">
    <div class="card-body">
        <!-- Header with Add Button -->
        <div class="flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
            <h2 class="card-title">Clients</h2>
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">
                Add Client
            </button>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Search Bar -->
        <div class="form-control mb-4">
            <input type="text" 
                   placeholder="Search clients..." 
                   class="input input-bordered w-full">
        </div>
        
        <!-- Table -->
        <div class="overflow-x-auto">
            <table class="table table-zebra">
                <!-- table content -->
            </table>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Pagination -->
        <div class="join justify-center mt-4">
            <!-- pagination buttons -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Timer Interface Pattern
```blade
<div class="card bg-base-200">
    <div class="card-body">
        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
            <!-- Client/Contract Selection -->
            <x-form-control label="Client" for="client">
                <select class="select select-bordered w-full">
                    @foreach($activeClients as $client)
                        <option value="{{ $client->id }}">
                            {{ $client->company_name }} ({{ $client->account_number }})
                        </option>
                    @endforeach
                </select>
            </x-form-control>
            
            <!-- Timer Display -->
            <div class="text-center">
                <div class="text-4xl font-mono">
                    {{ $timer }}
                </div>
                <div class="btn-group mt-2">
                    <button class="btn btn-success">Start</button>
                    <button class="btn btn-warning">Pause</button>
                    <button class="btn btn-error">Stop</button>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Work Location Toggle -->
            <div class="form-control">
                <label class="label">Work Location</label>
                <div class="btn-group">
                    <button class="btn btn-active">Remote</button>
                    <button class="btn">Onsite</button>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## üìù Account Number Generation Logic

Generate account numbers from company names:
1. Remove all spaces and special characters
2. Take first 8 characters
3. Convert to uppercase
4. If duplicate exists, append number (2, 3, etc.)

**Examples:**
- "Lingo Technologies LLC" ‚Üí "LINGOTEC"
- "ABC Company Inc" ‚Üí "ABCCOMPA"
- "Joe's IT Services" ‚Üí "JOESITSE"
- "IBM Corporation" ‚Üí "IBMCORPO"

```php
// In Client model observer
public function creating(Client $client)
{
    $companyName = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9]/', '', $client->company_name);
    $accountNumber = strtoupper(substr($companyName, 0, 8));
    
    // Check for duplicates and append number if needed
    $suffix = 1;
    $testNumber = $accountNumber;
    while (Client::where('account_number', $testNumber)->exists()) {
        $suffix++;
        $testNumber = $accountNumber . $suffix;
    }
    
    $client->account_number = $testNumber;
}
```

## üìù Contract Number Generation Logic

Generate contract numbers using account and service:

```php
// In Contract model observer
public function creating(Contract $contract)
{
    $accountNumber = $contract->client->account_number;
    $service = $contract->service_category; // IT, WEB, MARKETING, OTHER
    $year = Carbon::parse($contract->start_date)->year;
    
    $contract->contract_number = "{$accountNumber}-CON-{$service}-{$year}";
}
```

---

## üîí Permission Requirements

### Role-Based Access
- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Manager**: View all, manage work logs, approve time entries
- **Employee**: Create own work logs, use timer, view assigned contracts

### Specific Permissions
```php
// Permissions to create
'view-clients'
'create-clients'
'edit-clients'
'delete-clients'
'manage-contracts'
'manage-service-types'
'create-work-logs'
'edit-own-work-logs'
'view-all-work-logs'
'manage-contract-periods'
'view-reports'
'export-data'
'send-reports'
```

---

## üö¶ Status Workflows

### Contract Status
```
active ‚Üí expired (automatic based on end_date)
active ‚Üí inactive (manual deactivation)
inactive ‚Üí active (manual reactivation)
```

### Work Log Workflow
```
Any employee ‚Üí Creates work log entry
System ‚Üí Checks if over allocation
System ‚Üí Marks as overage if exceeded
System ‚Üí Applies appropriate rate
```

### Contract Period Workflow
```
Daily Job ‚Üí Check for anniversaries
Create period ‚Üí Set start/end dates
Track usage ‚Üí Sum work logs
Calculate overage ‚Üí Apply rates
Send report ‚Üí Email on anniversary
```

---

## üìÖ Anniversary Date Handling

### Monthly Reset Logic
- Contract starts May 24, 2025
- First period: May 24 - June 23, 2025
- Second period: June 24 - July 23, 2025
- Continues monthly on the 24th

### Month-End Edge Cases
- If start date is 29, 30, or 31
- Use last valid day of shorter months
- Example: January 31 contract
  - February: Resets on 28th (or 29th in leap year)
  - March: Resets on 31st
  - April: Resets on 30th

```php
// Calculate next anniversary date
public function getNextAnniversaryDate($contractStartDate, $currentDate)
{
    $startDay = $contractStartDate->day;
    $nextMonth = $currentDate->copy()->addMonth();
    
    // Handle month-end edge cases
    $lastDayOfNextMonth = $nextMonth->copy()->endOfMonth()->day;
    $anniversaryDay = min($startDay, $lastDayOfNextMonth);
    
    return $nextMonth->day($anniversaryDay);
}
```

---

## üìÅ File Storage Structure
```
storage/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ clients/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {client-account-number}/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contract_001.pdf
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contract_002.pdf

## üìå Notes & Decisions

**Important Decisions:**
- No hour rollover - unused hours expire monthly
- Account numbers use first 8 characters of company name
- Contract numbers include service category (IT/WEB/MARKETING)
- Hours reset on contract anniversary date (not calendar month)
- Each contract has independent hour allocations and overage rates
- Work location must be specified (remote/onsite)
- Monthly reports auto-send on anniversary dates
- Any employee can log time for any client/contract

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use Livewire for all interactive components
- Implement timer with auto-save to prevent data loss
- Use scheduled jobs for period creation and notifications
- Cache contract period lookups for performance
- Use database transactions for time entry creation
- Consider implementing websockets for real-time timer sync
- Add indices on frequently queried columns

**Future Enhancements:**
- Integration with external ticketing system
- Client portal for viewing their own usage
- Automated invoice generation for overages
- Mobile app for time tracking
- Slack/Teams integration for notifications
- API endpoints for third-party integrations
