## üéØ Development Principles

### UI/UX Standards (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **daisyUI Components ONLY** - No raw Tailwind for components
- [ ] **Dark Theme** - Use `bg-base-100/200/300` exclusively
- [ ] **Mobile Responsive** - Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px
- [ ] **Consistent with User Management** - Match existing patterns
- [ ] **Loading States** - All async operations must show feedback
- [ ] **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
- [ ] **Form Validation** - Real-time validation with Livewire

### Code Standards
- [ ] **Reuse Existing Components** - Check `/resources/views/components/` first
- [ ] **Follow Naming Conventions** - Match existing file/class patterns
- [ ] **Complete Files Only** - No partial implementations
- [ ] **Test Each Feature** - Full debugging before moving on
- [ ] **Document Complex Logic** - Clear comments where needed

## üé® UI Component Patterns

### Standard List View Pattern
```blade
<div class="card bg-base-200 shadow-xl">
    <div class="card-body">
        <!-- Header with Add Button -->
        <div class="flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
            <h2 class="card-title">Clients</h2>
            <button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">
                Add Client
            </button>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Search Bar -->
        <div class="form-control mb-4">
            <input type="text" 
                   placeholder="Search clients..." 
                   class="input input-bordered w-full">
        </div>
        
        <!-- Table -->
        <div class="overflow-x-auto">
            <table class="table table-zebra">
                <!-- table content -->
            </table>
        </div>
        
        <!-- Pagination -->
        <div class="join justify-center mt-4">
            <!-- pagination buttons -->
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Standard Form Modal Pattern
```blade
<div class="modal @if($showModal) modal-open @endif">
    <div class="modal-box max-w-3xl">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">{{ $modalTitle }}</h3>
        
        <form wire:submit.prevent="save">
            <!-- Form fields using x-form-control -->
            
            <div class="modal-action">
                <button type="button" 
                        class="btn btn-ghost" 
                        wire:click="closeModal">
                    Cancel
                </button>
                <button type="submit" 
                        class="btn btn-primary"
                        wire:loading.attr="disabled">
                    <span wire:loading.remove>Save</span>
                    <span wire:loading>
                        <span class="loading loading-spinner loading-sm"></span>
                        Saving...
                    </span>
                </button>
            </div>
        </form>
    </div>
    <form method="dialog" class="modal-backdrop">
        <button wire:click="closeModal">close</button>
    </form>
</div>
```

## üìù Account Number Generation Logic

The account number should be generated from the company name following these rules:
1. Take the first letter of each word in the company name
2. Convert to uppercase
3. Remove spaces and special characters
4. If less than 3 characters, pad with company name letters
5. Add a numeric suffix if duplicate exists

**Examples:**
- "Lingo Technologies LLC" ‚Üí "LTL"
- "ABC Corp" ‚Üí "ABC"
- "The Widget Company" ‚Üí "TWC"
- "IBM" ‚Üí "IBM"
- "A1 Services" ‚Üí "A1S"

---

## üîí Permission Requirements

### Role-Based Access
- **Admin**: Full access to all features
- **Manager**: View all, edit work logs, manage tasks
- **Employee**: Create/edit own work logs, view assigned tasks

### Specific Permissions
```php
// Permissions to create
'view-clients'
'create-clients'
'edit-clients'
'delete-clients'
'manage-contracts'
'upload-contracts'
'manage-tasks'
'create-work-logs'
'approve-work-logs'
'edit-all-work-logs'
'view-reports'
'export-data'
```

---

## üö¶ Status Workflows

### Contract Status
```
active ‚Üí expired (automatic based on end_date)
active ‚Üí inactive (manual with reason)
inactive ‚Üí active (manual reactivation)
```

### Work Log Status
```
pending ‚Üí approved (by admin/manager)
pending ‚Üí rejected (by admin/manager with reason)
approved ‚Üí edited (by admin only with reason)
```

### Task Status
```
pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí completed
(any status can go back to any other status)
```

---

## üìÅ File Storage Structure
```
storage/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ clients/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contracts/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {client-account-number}/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contract_001.pdf
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contract_002.pdf
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

| Date | Version | Changes | Author |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Jan 2025 | 1.0.0 | Initial development plan created | System |

## üìå Notes & Decisions

**Important Decisions:**
- Account numbers will be auto-generated and unique
- Contracts will be soft-deleted to maintain history
- Work logs require admin approval by default
- All timestamps will use the application's timezone setting
- File uploads limited to 10MB per contract

**Technical Considerations:**
- Use Livewire for all interactive components
- Implement eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Use database transactions for critical operations
- Consider implementing caching for report data
- Add indices on frequently queried columns

**Status Legend:**
- ‚è≥ Pending
- üöß In Progress
- ‚úÖ Complete
- üî¥ Blocked
- üîÑ Needs Review
